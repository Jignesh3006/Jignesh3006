# Projects

The Robust Data Ingestion Pipeline project employs Microsoft Fabric Data Factory to automate the validation and ingestion of CSV files from a specified source folder, ensuring high data quality through automatic checks for structure, data types, and duplicates. It enhances operational efficiency by providing timely error notifications for any failed files and supports scalable data management to handle large datasets with minimal manual intervention. This innovative solution is crucial for organizations seeking reliable and efficient data ingestion processes. Click on the link below to see a detailed overview of the project.

To build a medallion architecture in Microsoft Fabric for real-time analytics, begin by creating data pipelines to copy data from sample sources. Next, ingest streaming events using EventStream for immediate processing within Microsoft Fabric's Real-Time Analytics (RTA). Implement necessary data transformations in RTA to prepare the data for analysis, and develop interactive reports and dashboards to visualize real-time insights. Continuous monitoring and optimization of pipeline and dashboard performance are essential to ensure efficient data flow and responsiveness, facilitating informed decision-making based on real-time analytics.
